### About Tribeclick

We started a year ago as a Machine Learning focused AdTech company. Our main focus is to become the go-to place for AI powered online advertising.

### Technical challenges

In the Advertising world, the main challenge is response time. You might not know, but there is a lot of stuff happening on the backend anytime you see an Ad online. All that processing, filtering and analyzing needs to be done in less than 80 milliseconds! That’s why we decided to build our stack using Golang as our main microservice language.

Our stack includes Kafka, Spark and Django as well.

### Where are we?
